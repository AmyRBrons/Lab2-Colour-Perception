# Lab 2 - Colour and Perception

This lab session has two parts. In the first part, you will experience various physiological and psychological phenomenons related to your vision, colour perception and how the brain makes up missing visual information.  In the second part, you will explore how colour images are separated into different colour spaces and how these could be used to perform various useful function to enhance what you see.

Before you start this Lab Session, clone this repo to your local machine and do all your work on your local copy.

## Part 1 - Seeing Colour and Shapes
---

### Task 1 - Find your blind spot

Play the video [here](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE4_DVS/assets/blind_spot_test.mp4) and follow its instruction.  Write in your logbook what you learned from this task.

### Task 2 - Ishihara Colour Test

The Ishihara test is a colour vision test deisgned to detect deficiencies in the long and medium cones.  It consists of one set of pictures containing colour dots with a number embedded within.  Your goal is to identify the number you see in each of them.

You can start the test [here](Ishihara_test.md).

### Task 3 - Reverse colour

1. Get hold of a white sheet of paper and hold it up next to your screen.  
2. Now stare at white dot in the centre of the American Flag in funny colours shown below for 10 seconds.  
3. Suddenly switch your gaze to the white sheet of paper.


You should see the American flag in the normal red, white and blue colours.

Explain the reason why this happens.

### Task 4 - Troxler's Fading

Here is another example to demonstrate the Opponent Process Theory.  Play the video [here](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE4_DVS/assets/purple_dots.mp4) and follow the instruction.  

<video src="assets/purple_dots.mp4" width="640" height="320" controls></video>

Write down in your logbook the reason of what you see.  Read the Wikipedia page on Troxler's fading [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troxler%27s_fading), which explains this phenomenon and relates it to the human visual system.

[Here](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE4_DVS/assets/blue_circle.mp4) is another experiment to test the phenomenon.  Play the video and comment.

### Task 5 - Brain sees what it expects

Our brain interprets what we see based on our expectation.  Here is an example.  The image below shows two tables with blue and red tops.  Which is the larger table?  Measure this on the screen with a ruler (or just marking on a sheet of paper).  Write in your logbook the reason for this phenomenon.

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/table.jpg" /> </p><BR>

Here is another example, where our brain see what it expects instead of what light reaches the retina.  Which is darker, the square labelled A or B?

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/shadow.jpg" /> </p><BR>

To verify that in fact A and B are exactly the same colour of grey, you may need to capture this image and use an image editing to extract the B square and put it next to A for comparison.

### Task 6 - The Grid Illusion

When you stare at the centre of the grid below, you should see black dots at the intersection appearing and disappearing.  You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_illusion).

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/grid.jpg" /> </p><BR>

### Task 7 - Cafe Wall Illusion

Do you see the following brick wall layers are parallel?  Then measure the boundaries of each layer with a ruler.

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/bricks.jpg" /> </p><BR>

This phenomenon is not observed for the following image when the contrast is lower.

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/cbricks.jpg" /> </p><BR>

You can find out more about this [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf√©_wall_illusion).


### Task 8 - the Silhouette Illusion

[Here](http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE4_DVS/assets/dancer.m4v) is video of a spinning dancer.  Play the video and looking at it for some time, you may find that the dance would suddenly spinning in the opposite direction.  The explanation for this phenomenon can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_dancer).
